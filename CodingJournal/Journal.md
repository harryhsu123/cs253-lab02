    For this week I complete the work for create a tree and cat, these are a good practice for to see if the space and different symbole can take different space on pxies over computer and base of the my experiences yes there is difference but the difference is always realiviliy in terms of a ratio, so as long as you can control it you don't have to guess and run the code for test and see how the output has appear in the terminal.

    For the last day my job is to check if the code has possible issue base of the formating and submit issue has accur as well. It's important not to link to the module two template, I did it and it was confuse for the fact I only have limit option for submition and I realized the problem from search into my own git history activity. So it's important to be able to search debug and possbility not to make mistake as well.
